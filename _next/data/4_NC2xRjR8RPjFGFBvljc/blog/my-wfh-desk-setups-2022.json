I did some research, DIY some gadgets, bought some LED strips, two monitors, monitor stands, mechanical keyboard and new mouse. Iteratively to change the layout and reorganize the cables. It was a such great time to rethinking how the setups and arrangements can affect my daily work and productivity.</p>\n<p>I change and update my main desk setup consistently, so I realise that I should make a video or write a blog post to record current state of it.

I think there're two main reason for it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For recording, I always have some new ideas come out of my mind. So I try to change my setups if I think I need. The notes of the thinking process will give me a chance to review and to use it as a reference.</li>\n<li>Sharing with others. I found lots of people want to setup, design and optimise their daily work environment. Share these ideas can help others or give others some inspirations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f1982/planet-of-images/main/img/desk-long-1.jpg\" alt=\"The super big desk is one satisfying part of my setups\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f1982/planet-of-images/main/img/Untitled.png\" alt=\"The cable management under the desk\"></p>\n<h1>To be continue...</h1>\n","coverImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f1982/planet-of-images/main/img/front-setups-1.jpg","date":"2020-07-04T05:35:07.322Z","ogImage":{"url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f1982/planet-of-images/main/img/latest-project-wfh-setup-2022.png"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
