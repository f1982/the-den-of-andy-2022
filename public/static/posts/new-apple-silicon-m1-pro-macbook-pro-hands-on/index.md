My 2016 MacBook Pro with Intel CPU was becoming powerless since last year. Especially when I started working on some React Native project. The fans run crazy, the windows may be freezing when I run multiple applications. The spinner show up regularly.

Since the battery of my 2016 MBP was dead last week, I have to ask the IT department to replace a new MBP for me. I think maybe our IT stocked some of M1 chip MacBook Pro, they said you can get a new one this week.

I unboxed this brand new laptop in the office(just can not wait)which still have the special smell from the factory. And quickly setup the development environment I needed. Everything is so fresh and familiar.

I’ve used this M1 Pro MacBook Pro for about one week now. I have to say it’s really fast! I can not feel any lagging issues during my daily development workflow. Additionally, the 120 Herts refresh rate gives me a new level of screen experience.

I still remembered that when I was watching the Apple Event, I saw the notch on the design. That felt so bad. It’s not OCD(Obsessive compulsive disorder) friendly at all. But, when I handed-on it, actually in the first day. I observed the camera and the surrounding area for a while. After that, I almost forgot the notch! So, in my opinion as a non-OCD user, it doesn’t bother me too much.

Another very interesting thing is like this. Due to the COVID-19 spread so quickly in community and back and forth unstoppably. We’ve been WFH for more than half a year now. The camera of the previous 16 inch MBP is very poor. It can not handle with the low light environment very well.  Especially in the morning, the location of my desk against the light. By in this way, every time when I open the Zoom in the standup meeting, it feels that I am in a very dark room. I have to DIY a fill-in light designed for the meeting. To avoid that colleagues may think I am WFC (work from cave)
