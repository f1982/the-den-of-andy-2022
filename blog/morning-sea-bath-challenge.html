<p>When I woke up at around 6:40 am, the sun was nowhere in sight, but I was already wide awake and ready to go.

<p>Finally, around 7:10 am, I arrived at the beach, and to my surprise, there were already many people there, waiting for the sun to rise. But I couldn't wait any longer, so I quickly stripped off my clothes and walk into the ocean.

<p>I decided to move into the deeper areas and fully immerse myself in the salty water. It was an exhilarating experience, and I couldn't help but stare at the sky, the faraway mountains, and the clouds above. Life is so beautiful.</p>
<p>After about 20 minutes, I got out of the water, picked up my clothes, and went to the bathroom to have another refreshing cold bath. By the time I got out, the sun had already risen, and more people had arrived at the beach to run or jog. It was like nothing had ever happened, and I couldn't help but chuckle at the thought of how much more exciting my morning had been compared to a normal day.</p>
<p>I got back in my car and drove home before my daughter woke up, feeling energized and accomplished. As I drove, I spoke to myself, "I'll definitely do it again!"</p>

<p>昨天晚上，我突然决定接受一个我长期以来想要尝试的挑战：在日出前洗个海水澡。所以，昨晚我早早上床睡觉（在晚上11点之前），在入睡前，我将我的浴巾和换洗的衣服放进包里，以节省早上的时间。晚上我还做了两个乱七八糟的梦，这并没有影响我带着兴奋期待即将到来的体验。</p>
<p>我在大约早上 6:40 醒来，太阳还没有出现，但我已经睡眼朦胧地准备出发了。我跳进汽车，驱车前往海滩，但我从未在这么早的时候开车，我的车窗起了雾。开了冷气也不管用，我甚至停下来检查是内部还是外部的雾气。不过这都是小破事儿。</p>
<p>大约在早上 7:10，我到达了海滩，已经有很多人在那里等待太阳升起。但我是已经等不及了，所以我迅速脱下衣服，跳进了海里。水并不像我想象的那么冷，这可能是因为我已经连续一个星期洗冷水澡了。事实上，是如此舒适，不太真实，以至于我甚至感到有点温暖 😂！</p>
<p>我决定潜入更深的水域，充分沉浸在海水里。让自己和这个世界一样静下来，感受那份平静和安逸。我不禁凝视着天空、远处的火山和上方的云朵。生活还是很美好的。</p>
<p>小20分钟后，我从水中走出来，拿起我的衣服，去海边的 bathroom 再冲了一个淡水的凉。当我走出来时，太阳已经升起了，更多的人来到海滩跑步或慢跑。就像什么也没发生一样，我暗暗地笑了，想到了今天的这个早上与我平常的比起来是多么让我兴奋和激动。挑战成功！</p>
<p>在女儿醒来之前，我开着车回到了家，感觉到应该大约 5 杯咖啡级别的精力充沛。在驾车回家的路上我对自己说：“我一定会再来的！”</p>
<p>最后分享一下给我启发的 Huberman 的视频。</p>
