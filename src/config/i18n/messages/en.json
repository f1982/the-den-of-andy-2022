When I was in primary school I have seen some magazines that introduced how to make RC aeroplane, I was shocked by the content and started to absorb the information that I can get. But actually, for a long period of time, I cannot get the right data or cannot find the right place to buy the components I need. Thanks for the Internet development and I can quickly find the groups and tutorials which let me enjoy to make or even design aircraft by myself.",
