# Background

From Last year, I am working from home for the most of time, that made me to reconsider my desktop setups and working environment at home. I did some research, DIY some gadgets, bought some LED strips, two monitors, monitor stands, mechanical keyboard and new mouse. Iteratively to change the layout and reorganize the cables. It was a such great time to rethinking how the setups and arrangements can affect my daily work and productivity.

I change and update my main desk setup consistently, so I realise that I should make a video or write a blog post to record current state of it. So, I can look back after months or years, to do the comparison, that may be very interesting.

# Reason

Why I want to write this articles? I think there're two main reason for it.

- For recording, I always have some new ideas come out of my mind. So I try to change my setups if I think I need. The notes of the thinking process will give me a chance to review and to use it as a reference.
- Sharing with others. I found lots of people want to setup, design and optimise their daily work environment. Share these ideas can help others or give others some inspirations.
